# Tesla Takes the Wheel: Brand Comparisons and EV Adoption in Washington
Electric vehicles are no longer just the future — they’re the present. In this project, I explore how Washington State is embracing EVs, with Tesla clearly driving the momentum.

The data tells a compelling story of how quickly things are changing, and how one brand in particular — Tesla — is helping lead that transformation.
